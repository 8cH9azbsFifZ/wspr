                Quick Start Guide for WSPR v0.6
                -------------------------------

WSPR (pronounced "whisper") stands for "Weak Signal Propagation
Reporter".  This program implements transmitting and receiving
functions for a digital soundcard mode called "MEPT_JT", or simply
"the WSPR mode".

WSPR generates and receives signals using structured messages, strong
forward error correction, and narrow-band 4-FSK modulation.  Its
principal design goal is reliable copy at very low signal levels.  In
practice it works well at signal-to-noise ratios down to about -27 dB
in a reference bandwidth of 2500 Hz.


QUICK START
-----------

1. Download WSPR from the WSJT home page,
   http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/ .

2. Run the resulting executable file to install WSPR.  

3. Start the program by double-clicking on its desktop icon.  

4. Open the Setup -> Options menu and enter your callsign and
   6-character grid locator.

5. Enter the COM port number to be used for PTT control in the box labeled
   PTT Port.  (For example, enter 1 if you will use COM1.)  Enter 0 
   if you will use VOX control.

6. If you have more than one sound card and do not wish to use the
   Windows default sound card for WSPR, examine the list of sound
   devices in the console window (the one with black background).
   Enter the desired device numbers in the boxes labeled Audio In and
   Audio Out.

7. Enter your transmitter power in dBm in the appropriate Options box.

8. On the main screen, enter your SSB transceiver dial frequency and
   desired Tx frequency in MHz.  Your transceiver should be set to USB
   mode.  (You can also set the Tx frequency by double-clicking with
   the mouse on the waterfall display, after setting the Dial
   frequency.)

9. Click on "Rx" to receive only, on "Tx" to transmit only, or on the
   desired average percentage of transmission cuycles.  In this case
   the program will decide whether to transmit or receive during any
   given two-minute interval, and will do so in such a way as to
   randomize your T/R pattern.  This procedure will maximize your
   chances of receiving any other WSPR station operating within a +/-
   100 Hz range centered 1500 Hz above your dial frequency.

10. Be sure that your computer clock is correct to +/- 1 second.  If
    necessary you can make small adjustments by left- or right-clicking
    on the "Dsec" label.

11. WSPR will begin a Tx or Rx sequence at the start of each even UTC
    minute.  The waterfall will update near the end of each Rx
    sequence.

12. Check the box "Upload spots" if your computer is connected to the
    internet and you want your received spots uploaded to the WSPRnet
    database.  For infomation on this excellent resource, go to
    www.wsprnet.org.


Decoded Output 
-------------- 

In normal operation WSPR displays a single line of output for each
decoded signal, in the following format:

Date    UTC  dB    DT    Freq   Drift
-----------------------------------------------------
080406 1248 -22   1.2  10.140225  -2  VE1RG FN76 30  
080406 1248 -10   0.9  10.140246   1  VE1VDM FN85 25 
080406 1250 -18   1.0  10.140244   1  KS7S DM41 30   
080406 1252 -25   1.7  10.140212   1  W6SZ DM14 23   
080406 1256 -25   0.7  10.140198   1  N2JR FM18 37   
080406 1256 -15   1.2  10.140242   1  KS7S DM41 30   
...

The meanings of the colums are as follows:

Date:   YYMMDD
UTC:    HHMM
dB:     Received S/N in the standard reference bandwidth of 2500 Hz.
DT:     Offset between computer clocks at Tx and Rx stations.  
Freq:   Measured frequency of received signal (MHz).
Drift:  Drift of received signal over 2-minute transmission (Hz).

Time offsets DT greater in magnitude than about +/- 2 s indicate 
a significant timing error at the transmitter or receiver, or 
possibly both.  For best performance your computer clock should
be kept accurate to within +/- 1 s.

Frequency drift of +/- 1 Hz over two minutes is scarcely 
significant.  Drifts of +/- 2 s or larger should be corrected at
the transmitter, for best performance.  (Of course, receiver
drift could also contribute, but that case should be recognizable
because all signals would appear to drift by the same amount.)

Color coding is used in the bandmap to indicate how long it has 
been since a particular station was last decoded.  Red calls have 
been seen in the most recent 15 minutes, up to the last line of 
decoded text.  Yellow callsigns are 15-30 minutes old, light
gray 30-45 minutes, and darker grat 45-60 minutes.  After one
hour calls are eliminated from the list.
