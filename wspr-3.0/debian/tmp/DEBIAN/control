Description: Weak Signal Propagation Reporter
 WSPR (pronounced "whisper") stands for "Weak Signal Propagation Reporter."
 This program is designed for sending and receiving low-power transmissions
 to test propagation paths on the MF and HF bands.  Users with internet access
 can watch results in real time at WSPRnet.  Version 2.11 of WSPR includes FMT,
 a package of command-line utilities that can help you make highly accurate
 frequency measurements without expensive laboratory equipment.
