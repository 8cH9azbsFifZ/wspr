A very preliminary prototype of no-GUI WSPR
Sivan Toledo 4X6IZ

This prototype consist of:
  wspr_nogui.py         This is a version of wspr.py with all the GUI calls stipped out
  tkrep.py              replacement for 3 classes that are not just GUI related
                        but come from Tkinter, the GUI library
  WsprmModNoGui/*.py    __init__, advanced, g, hopping, iq, options, and palettes
                        These are versions of the files in WsprMod but with the GUI stipped out
                        
To build and run this, run the makefile at least up to the point that it builds w.pyd.
Copy WsprMod/w.pyd to WsprModNoGui (I am sure there's a way to avoid this, probably by setting
PYTHONPATH or something like that).

Now just run "python -O wspr_nogui.py" instead of running wspr.py.

The code uses the same wspr.ini and hopping.ini, so running it should be equivalent to starting up WSPR
and letting it run without touching the GUI.

I tested it in hopping and no-hopping modes, but RX only. Bugs typically show up as remaining calls
to GUI functions.

This is just a prototype; it can't be supported this way. one way make this maintainable is to refactor
the Python codes into a functional part (scheduling, reading files, etc) and a control part. The
controller could be GUI or text-based.
